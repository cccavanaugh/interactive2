<marquee direction= "right">my bathroom</marquee>
<marquee direction="left">A perfect viewing spot of the sunset every night. The last place I go before bed. 
Where I get ready to leave. It used to be rainbow fish themed, but there is still a fish stuck to the wall that couldnâ€™t get removed. My personal hair salon. My personal makeup counter. My personal spa.
Somewhere where I could spend the most amount of time. Where I watch Tik tok.The place where I smell the best. 
The place where I smell the worst. A lot of hair everywhere, because I share it with my sister. 
A place that I fight over. Somewhere that I go to cry.A place where I feel the best about myself.A place where I feel the worst about myself. Where I know I will leave with fresh breath.Where I used to listen to music. Where I now watch YouTube videos. The mirror swings open to reveal skincare products. The counter is divided perfectly down the middle for sharing. The place that causes the most fights between my sister and I. 
Where I learned to French braid. Where my parents used to brush my teeth for me. Where I learned how to swallow a pill.
