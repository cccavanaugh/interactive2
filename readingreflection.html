<p class="ex1">Through this article, we are forced to look at the web and the idea of design in a whole new light. Though I did not fully understand some of this reading, there were a few main takeaways that are important to consider. Is the web a place where content can be created, or is the web the content within itself. To some this concept probably sounds confusing, but when broken down while thinking about the idea of art it is actually quite simple. Art has been and always will be subjective. So in this case, the art of what goes on behind the scenes of the web is one thing, verus what the viewer is actually seeing on their screen. The beauty of design is that there are so many definitions to that word, and it means something different to each and every one of us. Through learning the ins and outs of graphic design, I have gained a respect for what goes into making something look nice, and the power art has over us. Before learning about code and what goes into building a website, I used my computer as a tool for my work, and as a way to expand my skills. As a designer these skills will help carry me through my future.
