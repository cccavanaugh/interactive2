  Hard as it is to say how to design, it is easy to say how not to design
Apparently, what constitutes a successful way of working depends very
much on the specific design problem, the situation and the character of
the designer, but failure and incompetence are universal.
  <br>
          <br>
OK, how do you fail as a designer? Well.
  <br>
          <br>
          <div class="box-2">
                           
                           
  <li>
Always cling to your first idea.
  </li>
          <li>
Jump into the details immediately.</li>
<li>Solve one aspect of the problem first.</li>
            <li>Ignore a stakeholder, preferably a vital one.</li>
<li>First design the form, then sort out how the thing should work</li>
<li>Promise too much to the client, really inflate his expectations.</li>
<li>Don't listen to your client, lie to him if necessary.</li>
<li>Be inflexible in your ideas and approach.</li>
<li>Try to surprise your client with a completed design.</li>
<li>Ignore any tests that say the design might be below par.</li>
<li>Wait for inspiration.</li>
<li>Stay 'fresh' by not gathering information.</li>
<li>Do not plan (because that takes too much time).</li>

             This is a good but uncomfortable exercise in self-reflection. We are all
sinners, some of the time.
