    <h1>My Bathroom</h1>
    <p>
      To some, their bathroom might not seem too important to them. 
      I often hear of people going in and out, and never spend a good 
      amount of time in their bathrooms. For me, that was never the case. 
      <br>
      <br>

      Growing up, my bathroom was where I spent a lot of my time. My mom 
      would do my hair there every morning before school, and she would help 
      me brush my teeth and make me take one of those purple fluoride pills 
      that tasted horrible. It was where I took baths every night, and I would 
      pretend to sell the soaps and shampoos to my sister like I was on an infomercial. 
      <br>
      <br>

      Fast forward to a time where I started taking showers, and I 
      preferred to be in the bathroom without my mom. She would visit 
      occasionally for times where she would help me take my temperature 
      and give me medicine, but for the most part now the bathroom 
      became my alone time. It was where I discovered I had acne at the 
      age of 11, and where I would try hundreds of dollars worth of 
      products to help fix my face. This bathroom was the place where 
      I discovered my first of many insecurities, but in the future 
      where I learned to overcome them.
      <br>
      <br>

      It was also the place where I tried one of my favorite things 
      in the world to this day, makeup. I could now cover my acne, 
      not well, but it was a start. I could express myself through 
      makeup and hair, and I loved every second of it. 
      <br>
      <br>

      My love for makeup and hair never died, but my skills have definitely 
      improved. Less acne and  a lot of purple eyeshadow later I was now 
      in high school, spending more and more time in my bathroom. Blasting 
      music before school as I got ready, fighting with my sister over 
      counter space and the mirror. It was also where I was taking insanely 
      long showers trying to figure out how to shave correctly, and my dad 
      would yell about how much hot water I was using. 
      <br>
      <br>
      
      Then there is now, where the rule of no showers after 10pm still exists, 
      but my time in the bathroom is much more relaxed. My sister and I are no 
      longer on the same schedule, let alone not home for a long period of time 
      together anymore, so the fights over who is spending too much time in the 
      bathroom is not an issue. The occasional fight still happening now and again, 
      and it sends shivers down my spine as I think back to high school, 
      but getting to be home together during college breaks makes it worth it. 
      <br>
      <br>
      
      My bathroom will forever be one of my favorite places, and I will continue 
      to love it until my parents sell my house. I think there will never be a 
      better bathroom in my eyes, until I have the chance to design one for myself 
      when I'm rich and famous, but that one will not hold the memories I have made 
      throughout growing up.
